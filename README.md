# first

Produce a top-ten word count list from a given text file. My first attempt at writing Clojure code.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run its main method from a repl.

## Options

You can change the file being read in core.clj. There are two sample files short.txt and some.txt. 

## Examples

Produces output like:

```
the -> 358
a -> 223
to -> 190
and -> 157
of -> 150
you -> 146
in -> 112
is -> 94
it -> 82
=> -> 82
```
